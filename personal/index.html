        <h2>YouTube</h2>
        <p>My YouTube channel features videos of casual vlogs, gameplay on modern Tetris platforms such as Tetrio and
          Jstris and other random videos. I enjoy making these videos because it allows me to share these moments with
          others, and create tangible memories that I can look back on in the future.</p>

        <h2>Twitch</h2>
        <p>I was able to achieve Twitch affliate streaming high-level tetris gameplay as the 4th ranked player in
          Australia (not anymore). I enjoy the interactive community and creating clips, as well as using it as a way to
          stream my study sessions to hold me accountable to stay on that grind.</p>

        <h2>Instagram</h2>
        <p>Instagram is where I share my digital artworks I started creating in grade 12. In 2022, I joined csesoc's
          creative portfolio learning skills in photoshop and illustration forcing me to step out of my comfort zone in
          Krita. Starting to draw has made me so much more appreciative of art in general.</p>

        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <p>My twitter account is a combination of personal thoughts and funny observations, with reviews of anime
          series, movies and manga. I enjoy engaging with others in discussions about these topics and sharing my
          opinions.</p>

        <h2>Reddit</h2>
        <p>My Reddit account is a place where I occasionally pop in to read people's thoughts on various topics, enjoy
          memes, and assist others by answering questions they may have. It's a fun way for me to stay informed and help
          out where I can.</p>

        <h2>MyAnimeList</h2>
        <p>MyAnimeList, is where I keep track of all the anime series I've watched. I use it to organize my watched list
          and also to discover new anime to watch. My favorite anime is 'A Silent Voice' and it moved me to tears.</p>

        <h2>Tetris</h2>
        <p>I have a strong passion for Tetris and have achieved great success in the game, ranking 4th in Australia and
          holding the title of the most efficient player globally at one point. I also organized Australia's first LAN
          tournament which was a huge success, and enjoy commentating.

        <h2>Osu</h2>
        <p>Osu is a rhythm game where players click circles to the beat of a song. Though I haven't achieved anything
          (forever stuck 6 digit), I find it incredibly fun to play. Even when listening to songs now, I can't help but
          tap my fingers to the beat.</p>
